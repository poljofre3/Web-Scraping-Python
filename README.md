# Web-Scraping-Python

Web scraping is an important tool for extracting valuable data from websites. With the increasing popularity of e-commerce we have a lot of data available on the internet. This project involves using web scraping techniques to extract product names, original prices, and discount prices from a sports running shoes website using the Python library Beautiful Soup.

The first step in the web scraping process is to identify the HTML elements that contain the relevant information. This is done by inspecting the source code of the website and using the developer tools in the web browser. Once the relevant HTML elements are identified, Beautiful Soup can be used to extract the data.

In this project, the extracted data is stored in Python lists and then converted to a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is then saved as a CSV file for further analysis or integration with other tools.

The resulting dataset can be used to analyze trends in sports running shoes prices, identify the most popular brands and models, and gain insights into consumer behavior. This information can be valuable for retailers, manufacturers, and consumers alike.

Overall, this project showcases the power of web scraping in extracting valuable data from websites. With the right tools and techniques, it is possible to gain insights into consumer behavior and market trends that would be difficult or impossible to obtain through other means. By using Python and Beautiful Soup, we can automate the process of data extraction and make it easier to access and analyze the data we need.
